# VibeCode: Your Guide to a Fun Coding Session ðŸš€

## 1. Pick an Idea (5â€“10 min)  
- State your goal in one sentence.  
  - *Ex:* "A website that shows a new random quote when I click a button."  
- Define "done" as one small, clear outcome.
  - *Ex:* "Done means we have a webpage that shows a quote and a button that loads a new one."

## 2. Set Up (5â€“10 min)  
- Make a project folder + open in VS Code.  
- Add a `NOTES.md` to write down goals.  

## 3. Roles (Switch Often!)

To make sure everyone participates, we'll use a pair programming format.

- **Driver:** Types the code.  
- **Navigator:** Guides + talks to AI.  
- **AI Assistant:** Suggests ideas, code, and fixes.

## 4. Talk to AI  
- Start with context:  
  - *Ex:* "I'm building a random quote generator in HTML/JS. I want a button to change the quote."  
- **ðŸš¨ Never share secrets** (passwords, API keys). 

## 5. Coding Flow  
1. Navigator asks AI the next step.  
2. Review AIâ€™s answer together.  
3. Driver adds useful code.  
4. Run (`index.html` in browser).  
5. Debug with AI if needed.  
6. Repeat until feature works!  

## 6. Wrap Up  
- Save work + notes.  
- Write what you finished + next steps.  
- Share your projectâ€”progress > perfection.
